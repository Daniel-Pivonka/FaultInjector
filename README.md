# Fault Injector

A fault insertion mechanism that can run concurrently with any deployed cloud environment
with the purpose of helping to test and validate the fault resilience built into deployments


## setup.py
Collects all the necessary information for FaultInjector.py to run fully by filling out the config.yaml file.

  -c, --ceph  setup will look for ceph fields in the deployment


## FaultInjector.py

  -sf, --stateful       injector will run in stateful random mode

  -sl NUMFAULTS, --stateless NUMFAULTS
                        injector will run in stateless mode with specified
                        number of faults

  -ex EXCLUDE, --exclude EXCLUDE
                        exclude a node by name in stateless mode (for the
                        purpose of monitoring)

  -tg TARGET, --target TARGET
                        specific a node type that will be the target of
                        stateless faults

  -d FILEPATH, --deterministic FILEPATH
                        injector will follow the list of tasks in the file
                        specified

  -t TIMELIMIT, --timelimit TIMELIMIT
                        timelimit for injector to run (mins)

### Classes:

---

#### Node Fault:

##### Node Kill
- Connects to a node and executes `echo c > /proc/sysrq-trigger` followed by `nova stop [node id]`
	- These commands cause the kernel to crash and then ensures the node wonâ€™t restart on its own.
- After the desired amount of time passes, the node is recovered with `nova start [node id]`

---

#### Ceph Fault:

##### OSD Fault
- Connects to the Ceph cluster via a Controller, Ceph, or in the case of an HCI deployment, an OSD-Compute node
- Executes `systemctl stop ceph-osd.[target osd number]` to stop the OSD
- Similarly, the OSD is brought back up with `systemctl start ceph-osd.[target osd number]`

##### Monitor Fault
- Connects to a Controller node and executes `systemctl stop ceph-mon.target` to stop the monitor
- Similarly, the monitor is brought back up with `systemctl start ceph-mon.target`

---

### Modes

##### Stateless:

- Spawn a number of threads equal to the number of faults specified in the flag given at runtime
- Each thread runs the Node Kill fault function from within the Node Fault class
- Downtime scales with the amount of time left up to a 45 minute limit (open to suggestions with this time)
- Writes a deterministic file

##### Stateful:

- Spawns a number of threads equal to the following:
  *number of threads= (number of monitors / 2)  + minimum replication size across all ceph volumes*
- Each thread selects from the available stateful functions (so far OSD and monitor faults)
- Each fault function is set to return None if it cannot execute.
- If that happens 3 times in a row, the thread is killed and a new one is spawned
  which has a chance to run an alternate fault function
- Downtime scales with the amount of time left up to a 10 minute limit (open to suggestions with this time)
- Writes a deterministic file

##### Deterministic:

- Spawns a number of threads equal to the number of lines in the deterministic file
- Each thread waits until its start time to begin to emulate the previous run as accurately as possible

### Usage:

---

##### Setup

- Run setup.py (with the -c flag if Ceph is part of the deployment)
- Review the config.yaml file generated and look for anything missing
    - There is a reference file under the name config_reference.yaml

---

##### Running the Tool:

##### Stateful Mode

- If a time limit is desired, run `./FaultInjector.py -sf [time limit (in minutes)]`
- Otherwise, run `./FaultInjector.py -sf`

##### Stateless Mode

- Stateless mode requires a parameter for the number faults desired to be active at once
- Specify it with the following syntax `./FaultInjector.py -sl [number of faults]`

	##### Additional Parameters Include

 	- **Time Limit** `./FaultInjector.py -sl [number of faults] -t [time limit]`

 	- **Target Node** (the target node type for faults) `./FaultInjector.py -sl [number of faults] -tg [node name]`
		- The script looks for `[node name]` in the stored types of all the nodes in the config.yaml file
		- Example: an input of `[control]` will flag all controller nodes

 	- **Exclusions** (exclude node(s) from faults): `./FaultInjector.py -sl [number of faults] -ex [node name]`
		- The script looks for the exact `[node name]` in the stored names of all the nodes in the config.yaml file

		- Specify multiple nodes with `./FaultInjector.py -sl [number of faults] -ex [node1 node2 node3...]`

		- Example: In a deployment with a single compute node named *novacompute-0*, an input of `[novacompute-0]` will
		           exclude that node, but an input of `[compute]` or `[novacompute]` will **not** exclude any nodes.

##### Deterministic Mode
- Deterministic mode requires a parameter for file path of the desired deterministic file
- Specify it with the following syntax: `./FaultInjector.py -d [filepath]`
