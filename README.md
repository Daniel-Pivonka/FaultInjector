# Fault Injector

A fault insertion mechanism that can run concurrently with any deployed cloud environment
with the purpose of helping to test and validate the fault resilience built into deployments

### setup.py
Collects all the necessary information for FaultInjector.py to run fully by filling out the config.yaml file.

  -c, --ceph  setup will look for ceph fields in the deployment


### FaultInjector.py

  -sf, --stateful Injector will run in stateful random mode

  -sl NUMFAULTS, --stateless NUMFAULTS
                        Injector will run in stateless mode with the specified number of faults

  -ex EXCLUDE, --exclude EXCLUDE
                        Exclude a node by name in stateless mode (ex.for the purpose of monitoring)

  -tg TARGET, --target TARGET
                        Specify a node type that will be the target of stateless faults

  -d FILEPATH, --deterministic FILEPATH
                        Injector will execute the list of tasks in the file specified

  -t TIMELIMIT, --timelimit TIMELIMIT
                        Time limit for the injector to run (mins)
                        
  -ft FAULT_TIME, --fault_time FAULT_TIME
                        The amount of time faults are active (mins)
                        
  -rt RECOVERY_TIME, --recovery_time RECOVERY_TIME
                        The amount of time faults are given to recover (mins)
                        
  -v VARIABILITY, --variability VARIABILITY
                        A range of time that may be added to fault time (mins)

### Classes:

---

#### Node Fault:

##### Node Kill
- Connects to a node and executes `echo c > /proc/sysrq-trigger` followed by `nova stop [node id]`
	- These commands cause the kernel to crash and then ensures the node wonâ€™t restart on its own.
	- Note that these have only been tested on VM deployments
- After the desired amount of time passes, the node is recovered with `nova start [node id]`

---

#### Ceph Fault:

##### OSD Fault
- Connects to the Ceph cluster via a Controller, Ceph, or in the case of an HCI deployment, an OSD-Compute node
- Executes `systemctl stop ceph-osd@[target osd number]` to stop the OSD
- Similarly, the OSD is brought back up with `systemctl start ceph-osd@[target osd number]`

##### Monitor Fault
- Connects to a Controller node and executes `systemctl stop ceph-mon@target` to stop the monitor
- Similarly, the monitor is brought back up with `systemctl start ceph-mon@target`

---

### Modes

##### Stateless:

- Spawns a number of threads equal to the number of faults specified in the flag passed in at runtime
- Each thread runs the *Node Kill Fault* function from within the Node Fault class
- Downtime scales with the amount of time left up to a 45 minute limit (open to suggestions with this time)
- Writes to a deterministic file

##### Stateful:

- Spawns a number of threads equal to the following:  
  *number of threads = ceiling(number of monitors / 2) + minimum replication size across all ceph pools*
- Each thread selects from the available stateful fault functions (so far, OSD and monitor faults)
- Each fault function is set to return None if it cannot execute.
- If that happens 3 times in a row, the thread is killed and a new one is spawned
  which has a chance to run an alternative fault function
- Downtime scales with the amount of time left up to a 10 minute limit (open to suggestions with this time)
- Writes to a deterministic file

##### Deterministic:

- Spawns a number of threads equal to the number of faults/lines in the deterministic file
- Each thread waits until its start time to begin which emulates the previous run as accurately as possible

### Usage:

---

##### Setup

- Run setup.py (with the -c flag if Ceph is part of the deployment)
- Review the config.yaml file generated and look for anything missing
    - There is a reference file under the name config_reference.yaml which contains both Ceph  
      and standard deployment attributes

---

##### Running the Tool:

##### Stateful Mode

- If a time limit is desired, run `./FaultInjector.py -sf -t [time limit (in minutes)]`
- Otherwise, run `./FaultInjector.py -sf`

	##### Additional Parameters Include
	
	- **Fault Time** `./FaultInjector.py -sf -ft [Fault Time]`
	    - The amount of time faults are active (mins)
	
	- **Recovery Time** `./FaultInjector.py -sf -rt [Recovery Time]`
	    - The amount of time given to faults to recover (mins)
	
	- **Variability** `./FaultInjector.py -sf -v [Variability]`
	    - A range of time that can be added to fault time (mins)

##### Stateless Mode

- Stateless mode requires a parameter for the number faults desired to be active at once
- Specify it with the following syntax `./FaultInjector.py -sl [number of faults]`

	##### Additional Parameters Include

 	- **Time Limit** `./FaultInjector.py -sl [number of faults] -t [time limit (in minutes)]`

 	- **Target Node** (the target node type for faults) `./FaultInjector.py -sl [number of faults] -tg [node name]`
		- The script looks for `[node name]` in the stored types of all the nodes in the config.yaml file
		- Example: an input of `[control]` will flag all controller nodes

 	- **Exclusions** (exclude node(s) from faults): `./FaultInjector.py -sl [number of faults] -ex [node name]`
		- The script looks for the exact `[node name]` in the stored names of all the nodes in the config.yaml file

		- Specify multiple nodes with `./FaultInjector.py -sl [number of faults] -ex [node1 node2 node3...]`

		- Example: In a deployment with a single compute node named *novacompute-0*, an input of `[novacompute-0]` will
		           exclude that node, but an input of `[compute]` or `[novacompute]` will **not** exclude any nodes.
        
    - **Fault Time** `./FaultInjector.py -sl [number of faults] -ft [Fault Time]`
	    - The amount of time faults are active (mins)
	
	- **Recovery Time** `./FaultInjector.py -sl [number of faults] -rt [Recovery Time]`
	    - The amount of time given to faults to recover (mins)
	
	- **Variability** `./FaultInjector.py -sl [number of faults] -v [Variability]`
	    - A range of time that can be added to fault time (mins)

##### Deterministic Mode
- Deterministic mode requires the file path of the desired deterministic run to be passed in as a parameter
- Specify it with the following syntax: `./FaultInjector.py -d [filepath]`
